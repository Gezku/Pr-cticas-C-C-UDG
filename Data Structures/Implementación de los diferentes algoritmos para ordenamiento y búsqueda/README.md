# Implementations of different algorithms asigned by my univeristy (Universidad de Guadalajara)

It's an implementation of a program with a menu that ask the user to enter the lenght and the elements of an array. Once the user has entered the lenght and the elements of the array a menu will be displayed, in which you can choose from 6 algorithms, and then decide what you wanna do with the array. The algorithms consist of the bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quickSort, linear search, and binary search.

-How to sort an array with the bubble algorithm
